        <h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
        <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses various technologies including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.</p>
        
        <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
        <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Key Differences Between AI and ML</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scope:</strong> AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way we would consider "smart." ML is a current application of AI based on the idea that we should be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning:</strong> AI can be rule-based and doesn't necessarily learn from data. ML specifically learns from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.</li>
          <li><strong>Goals:</strong> AI aims to create systems that can perform complex tasks. ML focuses on enabling machines to learn from data to give the desired output.</li>
